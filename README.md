# React-Static - Laravel Integration | Website Generator

This is the React-static side of the attorney web builder application. Once a user on the Laravel side of the application registers and enters a payment method, the application generates a unique user ID, which is passed then to the react-static website, and used as an reference for which JSON data to pull. The user ID is passed pretty simply - through unix build commands such as touch example.json and is documented more in the laravel application.
